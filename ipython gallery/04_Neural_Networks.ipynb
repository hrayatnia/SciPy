Each layer represents a single linear regression model. The nodes are connected to each other through inputs accepted from and outputs passed to other nodes. A *feed-forward* network is one in which these connections do form any directed cycles. See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network) for more detail.\n",

The XOR network is typically presented as having 2 input nodes, 2 hidden layer nodes, and one output nodes, for example see [here](http://www.heatonresearch.com/online/introduction-neural-networks-java-edition-2/chapter-1/page4.html). Such an arrangement however requires that the nodes in the hidden layer use a thresholding scheme whereby the output of the node is 0 or 1 depending on the sum of the input being greater than some fixed threshold value. However, such a network would violoate our model assumptions for training the network. Specifically, we could not use error backpropagation because the node activation functions would be step functions which are not differentiable. To overcome this, we will the *hyperbolic tangent*, *tanh*, as the hidden layer activation function and add a third node to the hidden layer representing a bias term. Our output layer will have a single node. We will interpret the out values as being 0 (or false) for output values less than 0 and 1 (or true) for output values greater than 0. The figure below provides a graphical representation of the network. Note, the parameters $w$ and $a$ are distinct for each layer, e.g. $w_{11}$ on the edge between $x_1$ and $h(a_1)$ is not the same $w_{11}$ on the edge from $h(a_1)$ to $\\sigma(a_1)$.\n",
